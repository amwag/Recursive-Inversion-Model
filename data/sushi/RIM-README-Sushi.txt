The authors of the sushi preference dataset, found at (https://www.kamishima.net/sushi/), have requested that their data not be redistributed.

You can find the data set on their website. If you wish to tests on the sushi dataset, follow the below steps.

1) Download the sushi3-2016.zip file.
2) Extract the contents of the sushi3-2016 folder in the zip file into this folder. 
3) You should see a file called sushi3a.5000.10.order in the same folder as ReformatSushi.R.
4) Run ReformatSushi.R, which adds comma seperation and removes some metadata from the permutations.
5) The file SushiClean.txt will be created which contains only the permutations in a CSV.

The authors of this code would also like to thank the creators of the Sushi dataset for its contributions to our research. Thank you!
